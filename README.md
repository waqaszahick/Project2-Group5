This is our second project, and overall 17th assignment. It is a "Restaurant Filter" website / application. Following are the details about our project:

How does this project website / application function?
The purpose of this project website / application is to provide an interactive service to filter restaurants in a variety of Australian cities by name, location, cuisine type, ratings and delivery service availability.
Furthermore, our project website / application provides the ability to view the data in a variety of ways, from interactive visualization, graphs and diagrams
to a dynamic map that can pin-point the location of each restaurant as well as provide information about them through mouse overs. 


Where did we get our data?
Our data was collected through the use of the 'Uber Eats API' and Google ratings API. 

How was the data stored?
Our data was converted to a CSV for ease of access and then uploaded to MongoDB for remote storage.

How is the data displayed?
Our project website / application displays the data in an interactive dashboard format with a navigation bar to allow navigation between the various graphs, maps and tables all through the website / application.
